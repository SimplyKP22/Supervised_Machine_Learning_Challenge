# Supervised_Machine_Learning_Challenge
## Overview:
	Machine learning uses software to predict specific outcomes based on a particular dataset by using different algorithms and parameters of the data. Depending on the data and the user's desired objective, different types of machine learning can be utilized. In this exercise, we will take a look at Supervised Machine Learning. This type of machine learning considers that the potential outcomes are known ahead of time, such as knowing that the result can only be true/false or a number within a set range (i.e., 1-5). 
	For this exercise, we will use two supervised machine learning models: a logistic regression model and a random forest model. We will determine which model will be better suited to analyze a dataset about creditworthiness based on set parameters. Each model has pros and cons, and so in this case, we will compare their accuracy scores to determine which model might be best suited for this scenario. 

## Instructions

### Retrieve the data

The data is located in the Resources folder.

* `lending_data.csv`

Import the data using Pandas.

## Consider the models

You will be creating and comparing two models on this data: a logistic regression, and a random forests classifier. Before you create, fit, and score the models, make a prediction as to which model you think will perform better. You do not need to be correct! Write down (in markdown cells in your Jupyter Notebook or in a separate document) your prediction, and provide justification for your educated guess.

## Fit a LogisticRegression model and RandomForestClassifier model

Create a LogisticRegression model, fit it to the data, and print the model's score. Do the same for a RandomForestClassifier. You may choose any starting hyperparameters you like. Which model performed better? How does that compare to your prediction? Write down your results and thoughts.
